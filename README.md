Gnome-Shell Extension Audio-Output-Switcher
===========================================

This extension adds a little entry to the status-menu that shows the currently
selected pulse-audio-output device. Clicking on that will open a submenu with
all available output devices and let's you choose which one to use.

Since version 5, it also provides a shortcut to quickly switch output sources: 
`<Super>`+`q`

Most importantly this extension is as simple as possible. Therefore it does not
include an input switcher or similar.
See Audio-Input-Switcher (https://github.com/anduchs/audio-input-switcher)
extension for microphone selection.
