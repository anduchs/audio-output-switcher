Gnome-Shell Extension Audio-Output-Switcher
===========================================

This extension adds a little entry to the status-menu that shows the currently
selected pulse-audio-output device. Klicking on that will open a submenu with
all available output devices and let's you choose which one to use.

Most importantly this extension is a s simple as possible. Therefore it does not
include an imput switcher or similar.
